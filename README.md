# Nigel Encalada — Professional Website

A simple, elegant static site. Six pages, one stylesheet, no build tools.
Hosting is free on GitHub Pages; the only optional cost is a custom domain (~$10–15/year).

## Pages

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Homepage: positioning, featured work, blog teaser |
| `career.html` | Career narrative + timeline |
| `unesco.html` | UNESCO & international work (+ photo gallery) |
| `belize.html` | National leadership in Belize |
| `blog.html` | Development, Heritage & Tourism blog — **update every ~2 months** |
| `recognition.html` | Publications, talks, media, affiliations |
| `style.css` | All design — you shouldn't need to touch it |

## One-time setup (~30 minutes)

1. **Create a free GitHub account** at github.com.
2. **Create a new repository.** Click **+** (top right) → *New repository*.
   Name it exactly `nigelencalada.github.io`. Set it **Public**. *Create repository*.
3. **Upload the files.** On the repo page, click *uploading an existing file*, drag in
   everything from this folder (all .html files, style.css, and — later — your images
   folder). Click *Commit changes*.
4. Wait 1–2 minutes, then visit `https://nigelencalada.github.io` — your site is live.

### Using nigelencalada.com

If you own (or buy) nigelencalada.com:
1. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Custom domain** → enter `nigelencalada.com` → Save.
2. At your domain registrar, add the DNS records GitHub shows you (four A records for
   the apex, plus a CNAME for www). GitHub guide: docs.github.com/pages → "Managing a
   custom domain".
3. Tick **Enforce HTTPS** once available (can take up to a day).

## Your every-two-months routine — the blog (~15 min)

1. Open your repo on github.com → click `blog.html` → click the **pencil icon**.
2. Find the comment block `HOW TO ADD A NEW BLOG POST`.
3. Copy the `<article class="post"> ... </article>` block, paste the copy directly
   below that comment (newest on top), and change the date, title, and paragraphs.
4. **Commit changes.** The live site refreshes within a minute or two.

## Adding photos

1. Create a folder named `images` and upload it to the repo.
2. On `unesco.html` (or any page), find the `TO ADD PHOTOS` comment and follow it —
   copy a `<figure>` block, point `src` at your filename, write a caption.
3. Use landscape photos ~1200px wide, saved as .jpg, for fast loading.

## Tip

You can always paste any of these files back into a chat with Claude, describe the
change you want (a new blog post, a new project, updated photos), and get the finished
file back to paste straight into GitHub's editor.
